# human-activity-recognition
Repository for my CEN6940 course project to perform real-time human activity recognition using deep learning and microcontrollers.

This project is inspired by the TensorFlow Lite [Magic Wand example project](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/magic_wand) and applies its ideas to human activity recognition using the open-source [w-HAR dataset](https://github.com/gmbhat/human-activity-recognition)[1].
